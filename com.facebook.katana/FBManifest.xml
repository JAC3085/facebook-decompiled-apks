We are working with partners to get deeper integration into Android.
These partners have agreed to give us exclusive access to additional features of the phone,
such as the ability to read (and therefore display) all of a user's notifications.
Such access will be provided via the custom "system permissions" defined in this file,
which must live in the root of the APK.

For now, because of this comment, the file should only be included in debug builds.

<permissions>
  <uses-permission name="com.facebook.system.permission.FACEBOOK_SYSTEM_DASH_SERVICE"/>
  <uses-permission name="com.facebook.system.permission.READ_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
  <uses-permission name="com.facebook.system.permission.LAUNCH_DASH"/>
  <uses-permission name="com.facebook.system.permission.LAUNCH_HOME"/>
